Experimenting with delivering glTF content using library: [https://modelviewer.dev/]()

The idea is to provide a simple way for first year digital media and design students to understand and play with 3D textures without them having to open a 3D program.

By creating a repo on GitHub it's possible to both share the glTF files (students can clone their own repos) and provide students with a web-based view of their work via ModelViewer.

See: [https://sminton.github.io/glTFdemo]() for an example.
