        <h1>Introduction to Game Production</h1>

        <p>So, you're interested in making games?  Good for you!</p>

        <p>My name is Sam Hinton and I'm a lecturer in design and media at the University of Canberra.</p>

        <p>This year (2021) we're running the first in what we hope will end up being a full major in Games Design.  Introduction to Games Production is the first of these units.<p>

        <p>If you'd like some more information about the unit then read on below.  Otherwise you can read the rather dry and boring official unit description <a href="https://www.canberra.edu.au/coursesandunits/unit?unit_cd=11683&version_number=1&rownum=24266">on the UC Web Site</a>.</p> 

        <h2><a name="what">So what's this unit about?</a></h2>

        <p>This unit is all about understanding how games are made.  It's a practical hand-on unit where we use a tool called Unity to build some simple games. Each game focuses on a different skill you need to make a game, and by the end of the unit we'll get you to modify one of the games you build as you were learning to build your own unique game.</p>

        <p>We also take a really wide view of what games are.  Most people's initial thought about games is stereotypical - first person shooters, competitive online etc.  In this unit I take a wide view of games.  Everything from The Sims, Bitlife and Stardew Vallety through interactive story games on to RPGs and Pokemon to platformers all fall within the remit of this unit. Some of the most creative and interesting games to have come out recently absolutely shatter gaming stereotypes.</p>

        <h2><a name="whizz">Don't I have to be a computer whizz to do this stuff?</a></h2>

        <p>Not at all!  In fact, this whole unit assumes you know absolutely nothing about computer programming or game development. If you'd asked me this question 10 years ago, I'd probably have said yes. But these days we have some really great tools that anyone can learn to use if they're prepared to put some effort in.</p>

        <p>One of the best things about this unit is that it's designed to be accessible to a wide audience.  I'm personally really interested in how people from any background can learn how to make creative digital works using techniques that used to be limited to computer science.</p>

        <p>Don't worry about this unit being too hard for you - instead, let me worry about making sure you're properly supported and that you have all the materials and contact you need to do well.  All you have to do is show up and engage!</p>

        <p>This unit especially welcomes women and people from diverse backgrounds.</p>

        <h2><a name="assessment">Will I have to write an essay or do an exam?</a></h2>

        <p>No, and no.  No essays in this unit.  We get you to do a small research assignment at the beginning of the unit (week 4), but you'll submit that as a short video.</p>

        <p>I don't believe in exams - they're stressful and really just test your ability to do an exam.</p>

        <p>This unit is all about learning through doing.  At the end of the unit you'll be able to demonstrate all you have learned by showing me what you can do.  And making games is a lot more fun than writing about them or doing exams about them!</p>

        <h2><a name="software">What software do you use?</a></h2>    

        <p>We will be using <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> in this unit.  It's free for non-commercial use and there are thousands of online tutorials and forums that you can go to for extra information and help.  Unity is also a fully-fledged game engine that has been used to build a number of independent professional titles.</p>

        <p>We'll also be teaching you some basic C# programming. If you have done programming before and have been put off by it, do try it again! This is a design unit, so we approach learning code a little differently to more traditional information technology courses.</p>
        
        <h2><a name="online">Can I do this unit online?</a></h2>
        
        <p>This unit is not designed as an online unit, but given the difficulty that many people have with attending classes on campus this semester, the unit will support people who can't come to class.  I still strongly encourage you to attend classes if you can, as being on campus is generally a better experience that sitting at home, and game development is more fun when shared with others!</p>
        
        <p>If you're going to be doing this unit online, just let me know at the beginning of semester so that I can make sure all the online people are properly supported!</p>
        
        <h2><a name="who">Who runs this unit?</a></h2>

        <p>This unit is run out of the Faculty of Arts and Design and is run in Canberra by <a href="mailto:sam.hinton@canberra.edu.au">Dr Sam Hinton</a> (that's me!). I have been working in games and interactive entertainment technologies for a LONG time and I'm absolutely stoked to finally be able to teach a unit in game design!</p>

        <p>I really like my units to be fun and engaging.  I like students to feel relaxed in my classes and I am not the kind of lecturer who fails people on technicalities. I encourage my students to come and talk to me whenever they want, and to discuss problems related to the unit so we can solve them.  At the end of the day, what I really want is for everyone in my unit to have a good time and learn!</p>
        
        <h2><a name="signup">Where do I sign up?</a></h2>
        
        <p>If you'd like to enrol in this unit, you'll need a free elective slot in your degree.  If you're not sure if you do, speak with your Faculty's course advisors, or go visit student central.  For information on how to find these people, see <a href="https://www.canberra.edu.au/content/myuc/home/course/course-advice.html">myUC course advice</a>.  </p>
                    
        <p>Once you know you're good to go, just enrol in the unit through <a href="https://idp.canberra.edu.au/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?execution=e1s1">myUC</a>, then go to the menu in the top left corner of myUC, click course > enrolment > unit enrolment and follow the advice there. The unit name is "Introduction to Game Production" and the unit code is 11683.</p>
