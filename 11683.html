<h1>Introduction to Game Production</h1>

<p>So, you found the poster and used the QRcode.  Good for you!</p>

<p>My name is Sam Hinton and I'm a lecturer in design and media at the University of Canberra.</p>

<p>This year (2021) we're running the first in what we expect will end up being a full major in Games Design.  Introduction to Games Design is the first of these units.<p>

<p>If you'd like some more information about the unit then read on below.  Otherwise you can read the rather dry and boring official unit description <a href="https://www.canberra.edu.au/coursesandunits/unit?unit_cd=11683&version_number=1&rownum=24266">on the UC Web Site</a>.</p> 

<h2>Who runs this unit?</h2>

<p>This unit it run out of the Faculty of Arts and Design and is run in Canberra by Dr Sam Hinton (that's me!). I have been working in games and interactive entertainment technologies for a LONG time and I'm absolytely stoked to finally be able to teach a unit in game design!</p>

<p>I really like my units to be fun and engaging.  I like students to fee relaxed in my classes and I am not the kind of lecturer who fails people on technicalities. I encourage my students to come and talk to me whenever they want, and to discuss problems related to the unit so we can solve them.  At the end of the day, what I really want is for everyone in my unit to have a good time and learn!</p>

<h2>So what's this unit about?</h2>

<p>This unit is all about understanding how games are made.  It's a practical hand-on unit where we use a tool called Unity to build some simple games. Each game focuses on a different skill you need to make a game, and by the end of the unit we'll get you to modify one of the games you build as you were learning to build your own unique game.</p>

<p>We also take a really wide view of what games are.  Most people's initial thought about games is stereotypical - first person shooters, competitive online etc.  In this unit I take a wide view of games.  Everything from The Sims, Bitlife and Stardew Vallety through interactive story games on to RPGs and Pokemon to platformers all fall within the remit of this unit. Some of the most creative and interesting games to have come out recently absolutely shatter gaming stereotypes.</p>

<h2>Don't I have to be a computer whizz to do this stuff?</h2>

<p>Not at all!  In fact, this whole unit assumes you know absolutely nothing about computer programming or game development. If you'd asked me this question 10 years ago, I'd probably have said yes. But these days we have some really great tools that anyone can learn to use if they're prepared to put some effort in.</p>

<p>One of the best things about this unit is that it's designed to be really accessible to a wide audience.  I'm personally really interested in how people from any background can learn how to make creative digital works using techniques that used to be limited to computer science.</p>

<p>This unit especially welcomes women and people from diverse backgrounds.</p>

<h2>Will I have to write an essay or do an exam?</h2>

<p>No, and no.  No essays in this unit.  We get you to do a small research assignment at the beginning of the unit (week 4), but you'll submit that as a short video.</p>

<p>I don't believe in exams - they're stressful and really just test your ability to do an exam.</p>

<p>This unit is all about learning through doing.  At the end of the unit you'll be able to demonstrate all you have learned by showing me what you can do.  And making games is a lot more fun than writing about them or doing exams about them!</p>
